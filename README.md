BERTRPC
=======

This is a modified version of [bertrpc](http://github.com/mojombo/bertrpc) for
interview exercises.

You need to have a version of Ruby `>= 2.2.2` to run this exercise.  You
may find it useful to run commands like these to get your execution
environment set up:

```bash
rbenv versions
echo 2.3.1 > .ruby-version  # or other available Ruby version
bundle install
rake test
```

Then take a look at issue #1 for further instructions.
